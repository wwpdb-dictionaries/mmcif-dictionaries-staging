This directory contains the text files required to build the:

        3-Dimensional Electron Microscopy Extension Data Dictionary


An ordered list of the text file components of this dictionary is 
contained in the file mmcif_em.PARTS.   This dictionary requires
components of the standard mmCIF data dictionary in CVS module
dict-mmcif_std, but this is currently not included in the 
extension dictionary.

The full dictionary can be built using the command:  

    Build.csh mmcif_em

 or 

    make compile
