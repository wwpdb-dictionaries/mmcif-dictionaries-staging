# It helps to indicate where problems may arise and so should be carefully
# checked.  The data values given in this example may be unrealistic but it is the 
# organization of the items that is important.

# DSV: we tried to keep sasCIF compatible with typical ASCII data files used 
# by everybody, such that existing programs may read sasCIF files without
# modifications. The style of such files is 
#
# ... ANY HEADERS
#   0.1   350   15 
#   0.2   325   15
# ...
#   0.9   150   10
# ... ANY HEADERS
#
# The data stream (momentum transfer, intensity, su_counting, the latter optional)
# is recognized and read in. Important are at least the two first items, which 
# must be the two first items. 
# This is possibnle to achieve also with your loops, e.g by
# reverting the loop

## IDB: In the following loops the items have been rearranged to match the ASCII 
## order given in your comment above. 
## But of course the user can arrange the items in any desired order; the order is 
## not specified in the dictionary, only by the order of the data names.
## Normally one would put the _*.id as the first item.  Here I have put it as the 
## last item. 
## I have left out the exposure_time which is discussed in the dictionary below.  
## It was in my original draft but removed in your counter example.
