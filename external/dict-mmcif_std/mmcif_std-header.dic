   Also unbalanced ##'s in same place
   Removed "End of Example" statement everywhere

   <saved newddl_all_4 at this point>
   Implemented category and ID pointers for entity category.
   Found all sorts of errors while doing this, and attempted
   to fix them consistently. Did not remove child data
   Items, even though they don't have to be specified - they
   should help keep all of this straight during the transition.
   Some silly reformatting to ensure that data values always
   have the first alphabetic character in column 33.
   More silly reformatting to put each example in an example
   loop on a separate line.

     Added unit type of electrons.
;
  0.6.3  1994-11-30

       Added _exptl_crystal_grow.crystal_id in that category
       Added _symmetry_equiv.id in that category - this may cause a

      character types for words and single line strings, respectively.
      The regular expressions for these items will match characters
      of upper and lower case but the primitive type is uchar so
      all comparisons are performed in upper case. This avoids
      problems with case, where case is really not important.
    + Reviewed all items with character data types and made the following
      changes (hopefully uniformly):
       -  Data items with single word enumerates were set to type 'ucode'.
       -  Data items with multi word enumerates were set to type 'uchar'.
       -  Any item which could potentially exceed 80 characters was
          set to type text.
       -  Items which are restricted to single words were set to type 'code'.
       -  Items which are short strings which may not span lines were
          set to type 'char'.
    + Moved aliases for anisotropic temperature factors from category
      ATOM_SITE to ATOM_SITE_ANISOTROP
    + Added category DATABASE_PDB_MATRIX to hold the SCALE and ORIGX
      matrices/vectors.
    + Modified the defintions of data types 'char1' and 'char3' to
      permit leading '+' to indicate a modification.
    + Checked dictionary with SIFLIB and returned to Paula ...
